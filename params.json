{"name":"Esnake","tagline":"An open-source insane Snake Game developed with Ergame (Python 2.7 + Pygame) ","body":"Esnake is an open-source exotic snake-game developed in Python with Ergame, a custom cluster-fuck of code that the author dared to call an Engine (Made with Pygame). Everything in the game is mine except for the otf font made by unknown hands, the random space image, Pygame and Python (Obviously). I've composed the track of it, and there's a readme about it in the proper folder.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy it, I'd really enjoy to read some feedback on my email: ericsonwrp@gmail.com (Or just send me a message on github.. Ericson Willians).\r\n\r\nConcerning the code, be aware that the ONLY ACTUAL FILE of the game is \"run.py\", for the rest is my engine (So, you'll never understand it without reading the engine, since I've changed the standard \"pygame structure\"... considerably).\r\n\r\nConcerning CRASHES:\r\n\r\nIf you've messed with the options too creatively, just erase the options.edt file (The game will detect the non-optionness and will create a default one (The same applies to the highscore file)).\r\nIn case of any other obscure crash while eating the food in corners in obscure situations, just pray.\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\n![](http://s29.postimg.org/rcjazosuf/main_menu.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://s30.postimg.org/r4hsgxkf5/classic.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://s15.postimg.org/4x70r7wuz/mazy.jpg)\r\n\r\nThank you for playing it,\r\n\r\nEricson Willians.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
